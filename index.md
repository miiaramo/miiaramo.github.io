## Hello, my name is Miia

I am a data professional currently working as a data engineer. My goal is to grow to be a data architect with some serious hands-on attitude. I am always happy to learn something new. I created this site to practice basic consepts of web pages, and to showcase my personality and ambitions.

My free time interests change quite often - horses might be the only interest I've carried with me throughout life. 

Just to mention some interests of mine:
* Horses and riding
* Golf
* Sailing/boating
* Audio books
* Painting
* Golf
* Running
* Writing
